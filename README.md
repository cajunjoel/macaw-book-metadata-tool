macaw-book-metadata-tool
========================

A tool for collecting page-level metadata of digitized book-like objects to share with the Internet Archive.

Macaw performs three major tasks in the process of digitizing a book-like item:

* Import and management of the images from the scanner or camera.
* Collection of the page-level metadata that describes the physical aspects of the page.
* Post-processing and exporting/uploading the digital book to other systems.

Macaw is built in PHP using CodeIgniter and uses PostgreSQL for the database. Further requirements can be found in the wiki.

There is a mailing list for Macaw located at Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/macaw-discussion

An (older) VirtualBox VM image is available at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vgm7pzczdafwjxe/w79yCR-__c
